must be released as a beta by the project and submitted to beta. Once the
final release becomes available in testing, all the alpha (and beta) versions
for this release are automatically removed.

Package Licenses: any license that is approved as "Open Source License" by the
Open Source Initiative or as "Free Software License" (whether GPL-compatible
or not) by the Free Software Foundation.
