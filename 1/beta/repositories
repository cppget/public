summary: C++ package repository, beta section
description: \
This section contains beta versions of packages. Generally, no significant
interface changes are expected in beta versions before the final release.
Note that beta versions are never migrated to the testing section. Rather,
the version must be released as final by the project for this to happen.

Complements the testing and stable sections.
