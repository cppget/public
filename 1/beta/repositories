Beta versions are never migrated to the testing section. Rather, the version
must be released as final by the project and submitted to testing. Once the
final release becomes available in testing, all the beta (and alpha) versions
for this release are automatically removed.

Package Licenses: any license that is approved as "Open Source License" by the
Open Source Initiative or as "Free Software License" (whether GPL-compatible
or not) by the Free Software Foundation.
